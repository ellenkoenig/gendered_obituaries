  headline: Munnu Kasliwal, 54, Jeweler for the Elite
  lead_paragraph: From an old mansion on Mirza Ismail Road in Jaipur, India, the jeweler
    Munnu Kasliwal presided over an unlikely global empire. To the broader public
    Mr. Kasliwal's name was not nearly as familiar as those of Cartier or Harry Winston,
    but his family-owned emporium, the Gem Palace , has for decades been a valued
    secret passed along via word of mouth by international connoisseurs. Collected
    by European royals, Italian designers, Arab sheiks, international society queens
    and the merely moneyed, who could find his designs for sale at the Metropolitan
    Museum of Art and the Neue Galerie in Manhattan as well as at Barneys New York,
    Mr. Kasliwal's baubles were also particular favorites of celebrities, whom he
    cultivated with unassuming charm.
